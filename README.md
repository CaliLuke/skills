# Skills

A personal collection of agent skills I've built for Claude Code. These are tools and instructions that I find useful — feel free to browse, copy, or adapt anything that helps you.

## What's Here

Each folder in [`skills/`](./skills) is a self-contained skill with a `SKILL.md` file containing instructions Claude can follow. Some have helper scripts or reference docs.

Browse around and grab what you need.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add CaliLuke/skills
```

Or copy a skill folder into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory.

## License

MIT — do whatever you want with these.
